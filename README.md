- Height: The units are in centimeters(cm) 
- Weight: The units are in kilograms (kg) 
- Age: Your age
- Pre-meal glucose level: The units are in mg/dL rather than in mmol/L
- Carbohydrate: The units are in grams, and please calculate the carbohydrate content in the food before using our products.

After clicking the "send" button, the data will be sent to the backend and used as input of the machine learning model to predict your post-meal blood sugar level. Note that the color of the predicted blood sugar level will change, green indicates acceptable blood sugar levels, whereas red indicates dangerous blood sugar levels.

**Currently only using pre-meal blood sugar level and carbohydrate as model input.*
